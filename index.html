                "The Luffy robberies were a series of robberies in Japan that took place in 2021 and 2022. Linked to the alias "Luffy," these robberies are suspected to have been organized by detainees based in the Philippines. In 2023, four Japanese nationals were deported back to Japan due to their suspected involvement in the Luffy robberies." - Doug
